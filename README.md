# appointmentsForAll
A appointment scheduling web application where anyone can create an appointment with the site owner. The user specifies the date, time, name, email, phone number, subject, and any specific notes while filling the appointment form. Each field should be mandatory. The user does not need to create a user account in the system. The subject of the appointment request should be the reason for the appointment. If the requested date and/or time is not available, an error message occurs. In that case, the user needs to change the date and/or time. The appointments can be for a maximum of one hour. Once the appointment is created, the website shows a unique appointment ID for the request. The user can edit and/or delete the appointment up to 48 hours before the appointment date. The user can access the edit/delete menu of the appointment by specifying their last name and appointment ID. The site ownerâ€™s account should be predefined in the system. When the site owner logs into the system with a username and password, they can see all the appointments. The appointments can be listed daily, hourly, or weekly and the site owner can delete the appointments within the 48 hours of the appointment. This system can be used by anyone including doctors, dentists, and so on.
